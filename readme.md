playing_with_angular_02
=======================

A first(2) shared GIT for my AngularJS experiences...

Hereunder is the project from wich I was starting...

# `rx.angular.js` - Reactive Extensions Bindings for AngularJS

This library serves as a bridge between the [Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

With this library, you will be able to do such things as easily watch values as they change, as observable sequences such as:

```js
angular.module('example', ['rx'])
  .controller('AppCtrl', function($scope, observeOnScope) {

    // Listen for changes on the name
    observeOnScope($scope, 'name').subscribe(function(change) {
      $scope.observedChange = change;
      $scope.newValue = change.newValue;
      $scope.oldValue = change.oldValue;
    });
  });
```

And with your HTML markup you can use it like this:
```html
<div class="container" ng-app="example" ng-controller="AppCtrl">
  <h2>Reactive Angular</h2>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>observedChange {{observedChange}}</li>
    <li>newValue: {{newValue}</li>
    <li>oldValue: {{oldValue}}</li>
  </ul>  
  
  <input type="text" ng-model="name" />
</div>
```
Another example is where we can create an Observable sequence from such things ng-click expressions where we can search Wikipedia:

```js
angular.module('example', ['rx'])
  .controller('AppCtrl', function($scope, $http, rx) {

    function searchWikipedia (term) {
      return rx.Observable
        .fromPromise($http({
          url: "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?&callback=JSON_CALLBACK",
          method: "jsonp",
          params: {
            action: "opensearch",
            search: term,
            format: "json"
          }
        }))
        .map(function(response){ return response.data[1]; });             
    }

    $scope.search = '';
    $scope.results = [];

    /*
      Creates a "click" function which is an observable sequence instead of just a function.
    */
    $scope.$createObservableFunction('click')
      .map(function () { return $scope.search; })
      .flatMapLatest(searchWikipedia)
      .subscribe(function(results) {
        $scope.results = results;
      });
  });
```

And the HTML markup you can simply just use a ng-click directive much as you have before, but now it is an Observable sequence.
```html
<div class="container" ng-app="example" ng-controller="AppCtrl">

  <input type="text" ng-model="search">
  <button ng-click="click()">Search</button>

  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="result in results">{{result}}</li>
  </ul>

</div>
```
This only scratches the surface of what is possible when you combine the two libraries together.

## Community Examples ##

There are a growing number of community samples using RxJS and Angular.js, including:
- [ninya.io](http://www.ninya.io/) - [Code](https://github.com/ninya-io/ninya.io)

## Dive In! ##

You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/tree/master/docs) as well as examples [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/tree/master/examples) and plenty of [unit tests](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/tree/master/tests).

## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.

```
## Contributing ##

There are lots of ways to [contribute](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/wiki/Contributions) to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/wiki/Contributors).

You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Rx Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.
